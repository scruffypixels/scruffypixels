	<p>My interests have always focused on the process of making things, anything that seems interesting. I drew comics as a kid. I wrote my first lines of code in BASIC with my dad when I was 10 years old. My bachelor’s degree is in creative writing. I’ve built some pretty funny looking – but still stable – furniture.</p>
	
	<p>The gist of all of this is that the medium and the method aren’t important to me. I’m just as happy pushing pixels in Photoshop as I am writing javascript, as long as the end result is an interesting product. There’s three pieces to any project that get me fired up to work:</p>
	
	<ol>
		<li>I want to learn and challenge myself.</li>
		<li>I want to solve problems.</li>
		<li>I want to make things that are engaging and beautiful.</li>
	</ol>
	
	<p>The internet has become a really big place in recent years, and there’s so many amazing opportunities to create really incredible things. I’m not one to pigeonhole myself into just doing one type of work, because there’s so many ideas out there to explore. You can <a href="{{ site.url }}/work/">see some of the things I’ve made</a>, or <a href="{{ site.url }}/blog/">read various thoughts</a> on the processes of making things.</p>
	
	<h2>The Nitty-Gritty</h2>
	
	<p>When it comes down to the specifics, I suppose the closest job title that fits is “front-end designer and developer” (I’m not entirely sure anyone in the industry has a firm grasp on what job titles mean anymore ). My skillset revolves around building things that help people interact with and consume content: design the interface and user experience, and then build it. The Photoshop/Sketch wireframes and mockups to honest-to-god html/css/javascript arena is where I spend most of my time and energy. It’s the moment where visual and interaction design help a user consume content that I spend my time identifying, building, and refining.</p>
	
	<p>I’m not a designer who makes logos, nor am I a developer wrangling database calls. Can I do (and have I done) both? Sure, but there are better people at those ends of the spectrum than I am. My goal is to help connect those extremes, producing a product that’s exciting to use, and makes you say, “now that’s rad.”</p>
	
	<p>More specifics, you say? Okay: for the last few years until February 2016, I’ve been a jack-of-all-trades developer at <a href="http://www.rosemontmedia.com">Rosemont Media</a>, where I’ve done everything from build WordPress websites from PSDs to help push new product development. I started <a href="http://www.noblenarrative.com">Noble Narrative</a> &mdash; a company focused on storytelling in design, and telling stories with design. I created <a href="http://www.theflyingpeanut.com">The Flying Peanut</a>, a digital surf magazine, where I’m the designer/developer/writer/photographer.</p>
	
	<h2>The Less-Essential</h2>
	
	<p>A quick hit parade on the person behind the madness above: avid (terrible) surfer. Barbecue aficionado (I make a mean batch of smoked chicken wings). Bachelor’s degree from Virginia Tech in English, with a focus on writing fiction (a trail of unpublished novels and short stories follows behind me). Unashamed pug person.</p>
